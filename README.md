# Generative-Adversarial-Network-1-D
Designed a generator G that generates data from a desired distribution using multi-layer perceptron (only fully connected layers with non-linearities) which takes a single scalar z as input and outputs a single scalar x. Complemented the generator G with a discriminator D for an adversarial training which also uses multi-layer perceptron (only fully connected layer with non-linearities). D takes a single scalar x  as input and outputs a [0,1] value for classification; x is the output from G and xdata is a sample from the desired data distribution.
